<h2>About Egypt</h2>
<p>Egypt was a vast kingdom of the ancient world. It was unified around 3100 B.C.E. and lasted as a leading economic and cultural influence throughout North Africa and parts of the Levant until it was conquered by the Macedonians in 332 B.C.E.</p>
<p>Egypt is home to some of the world's most famous and stunning ancient monuments and lies in North Africa. Libya borders the western side of Egypt, while the eastern side edged by the Red Sea and the northern side by the Mediterranean Sea. Travel directly south of Egypt and you will find the Republic of Sudan, which is Africa's biggest country by overall area.</p>

  <p>Egypt holidays are unforgettable, not only for their history and sightseeing, but for the colourful characters, extremely sunny and hot weather, and the rather endearing lifestyle. No trip to Egypt is really complete without visiting Cairo, its bustling capital city. Here you will discover the awe-inspiring Pyramids of Giza, the equally impressive and much loved Sphinx, and the treasures of one of the country's most well-known pharos, Tutankhamun. Cheap holidays to Egypt and in particular, Cairo, are becoming more and more readily available, particularly when booked far in advance and during the hot and often humid summer months - the low season. The main towns and cities in Egypt line the banks of the winding River Nile and rarely stray far from the waterfront.</p>
